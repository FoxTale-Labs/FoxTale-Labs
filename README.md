A FOSS Linux based operating system inspired by the concepts and designs of [Avdan](https://www.youtube.com/@Avdan) and our Website is [https://avdanos.com/](https://avdanos.com/) and we also got a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@avdanos).<br><br>

[FyreBlitz](https://fyreblitz.com) is a company that I'm building and it's meant to be the next generation of hosting and project management, you can manage teams, do advanced source control, AI check, document, comment code, live collaborate, auto-deploy and a lot more!<br>
Currently it's not released yet, so the website is just showing "Coming Soon".<br><br>

<img width="200" alt="ArcticOS" src="https://github.com/FoxTale-Labs/FoxTale-Labs/assets/72300200/44115329-9597-4ea5-a45a-db0511ca5c0f"><br>
And finally ArcticOS, it's the operating system I'm working on myself with my small team of developers. It got interesting features such as full Windows Native support for Drivers and Win32 Apps. It's currently not in public beta so I can't give access sadly 😞, but a public beta will be out soon.<br>
Our [🖥️ website](https://arcticos.org) is also still a W.I.P.

Ofc I used other languages than these in the past, but I stopped using most of them. For example I used to use Java and even began my developer career with it.

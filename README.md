[FyreBlitz](https://fyreblitz.com) is a service that I've been building and it's meant to be the next generation of DevOps: Ditch GitHub and do your collaboration, management, testing, source control, integrations, calender, and AI here!
<br>
Currently it's not released yet, so the website is just showing "Coming Soon".<br>

Looking at my other (hobby) project, ArcticOS, it's the operating system I'm working on myself with a small team of developers. It got interesting features such as full Windows Native support for Drivers and Win32 Apps. It's currently not in public beta so I can't give access sadly üòû, but a public beta will be out soon.<br>
Our [üñ•Ô∏è website](https://arcticos.org) is also still a W.I.P.<br><br>

And finally AvdanOS, a FOSS Linux based operating system inspired by the concepts and designs of [Avdan](https://www.youtube.com/@Avdan) and our Website is [https://avdanos.com/](https://avdanos.com/) and we also got a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@avdanos). I used to be the upper manager at the project andU UI/UX designer. Nowadays I am a public relations team member.

And yes, ik that calling CSS/HTML (& MySQL sometimes) is a hot topic, but I'd say it is.
